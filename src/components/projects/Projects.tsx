      'This project developed a desktop application for checking exchange rate with Java and JavaFX.',
      'Implemented the whole UI design with JavaFX and MVP architecture to isolate the model and view layer. The rate is displayed with real-time data through API call.',
      'Used a stage management system to solve the problem, that to avoid the map view and main app view generate diï¬€erent instances while reloading multiple times.',
      'Improved the user experience by adding multi-thread to avoid frozen screen. I used JavaFX concurrency class Task to handle the background API operation, so that the main UI thread will not be blocked while handling the API call.',
